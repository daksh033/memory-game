## 🚀 How to Play  
Click on any card to flip it and reveal the hidden symbol.
Select another card to try and find its matching pair.
If the two cards match, they remain open; if not, they flip back after a short delay.
Continue flipping until all pairs are matched.
Win the game by matching all cards in the least number of moves and shortest time possible.
Use the Restart button anytime to shuffle and start a new game.
